# On3 Solana Backend Repository

Welcome to the On3 Solana Backend Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers interested in building applications and services on the Solana blockchain. It focuses on providing educational value by showcasing various Solana-related actions in the backend.

## Features and Security

Please note that while this repository covers a wide range of Solana-related actions, certain features of On3, such as authentications, DBMS, encryptions, and payments, are excluded to prioritize the security and privacy of our users. These features involve sensitive operations and are kept private to ensure the utmost protection.

## Updates and Learning

We are committed to keeping this repository up to date by continuously adding new Solana modules and functionalities. We encourage you to explore the code, learn from it, and leverage the knowledge gained to build innovative applications on the Solana blockchain.

## Join our Discord Community

For further assistance or if you have any questions, we invite you to join our Discord community at [https://discord.gg/4933EbdsRf](https://discord.gg/4933EbdsRf). We have set up an exclusive channel for developers interested in building on Solana and becoming part of the VORLD community.

In addition to providing a platform for discussion and collaboration, we will be creating infrastructure tools for game and app development. Many of these tools will be shared as open-source modules, enabling developers to leverage them in their own projects.

Happy learning and building! Let's together unleash the potential of Solana and drive innovation in the decentralized ecosystem.



# ON3 Node.js Project

This is a Node.js project that allows you to interact with the Solana blockchain using the Solana JavaScript SDK.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or create a new directory for your project.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

## Usage

### 1. Selecting RPC Endpoints

In the `constants.js` file, you can define the available RPC endpoints for Solana. Modify the file to add or remove endpoints as needed.

### 2. Connecting to a Solana Network

In the `app.js` file, you can use the `selectEndpoint` function to choose an RPC endpoint based on an integer input. Update the `connectToEndpoint` function to include your specific Solana code.

To run the project and connect to a Solana network, execute the following command:


npm run dev


This will execute the `dev` script defined in the `package.json` file, which runs the `app.js` script.

Make sure to update the `app.js` file with your actual Solana code and modify the connection logic as needed.
